  about-me: |
    I'm a third-year PhD Student in the Statistics Department. I'm working with Dr. Haiyan Huang to develop deep learning methods for identifying novel gene-gene relationships in known pathways from gene coexpression matrices. And with Dr. Gregory Goldgof at MSKCC, I'm currently developing computer vision and deep-learning-based tools to help pathologists predict patient outcomes from peripheral blood smears. I've interned as a data scientist for two companies--ShareMy.Health and Typenex Medical--and hope to do industry work related to computational medicine/biology post-graduation.
